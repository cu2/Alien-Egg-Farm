Eggs are a great source of energy. Just think about Rocky. And what is the ultimate source of energy? Alien eggs!
In this game you are set on a planet trying to collect as many alien eggs as possible in 3 minutes. The trick is to let the aliens lay eggs, hatch and lay more eggs for a while, to maximize the number of eggs collected. But be careful to kill all the aliens before time is up, otherwise you will lose.
