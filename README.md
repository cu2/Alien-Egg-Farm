Alien Egg Farm
==============

Eggs are a great source of energy. Just think about Rocky. And what is the ultimate source of energy? Alien eggs!

In this game you are set on a planet trying to collect as many alien eggs as possible in 3 minutes. The trick is to let the aliens lay eggs, hatch and lay more eggs for a while, to maximize the number of eggs collected. But be careful to kill all the aliens before time is up, otherwise you will lose.

> I LOVE this one. Everything about it is awesome. Except the really weak link to energy :p
> Graphics, awesome. Consistent theme, great style, and well done! Music and sound effects, brilliant. They fit in with the graphics & style so perfectly Concept / Gameplay: Awesome concept, and well executed! Except for the really weak link to energy of course :p It's a great concept though, and makes for awesome gameplay! Really well put together, and is great fun to play :) 3 mins is a little too long though, I think :p Managed to gather 1200+ eggs, but couldn't kill the aliens, they were out of control, so I lost :) I love this so much, awesome work!
